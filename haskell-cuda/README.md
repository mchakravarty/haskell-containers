Docker image supporting Haskell GPU programming:

* accelerate-cuda-0.15.0.0 and
* accelerate-fft-0.15.0.0.

The current library versions are based on LTS Haskell 1.4 with GHC 7.8.4 and CUDA 6.5.

Available from the public Docker registry in two flavours:

* `mchakravarty/haskell-cuda:lts1.4-cuda6.5`: plain image executing `ghci` by default
* `mchakravarty/haskell-cuda:lts1.4-cuda6.5-onbuild`: build image to containerise Cabal executables

## Usage of the build image

Create a Dockerfile that just contains

```
FROM mchakravarty/haskell-cuda:lts1.4-cuda6.5-onbuild
```

Place this Dockerfile into the application directory containing a Cabal file or into a directory together with a Cabal source distribution tarball (as generated by `cabal sdist`).

Build your application container image, including your pre-compiled application, with

```
docker build -t app .
```

By default, the application container will execute `cabal run`, passing any run arguments on.

## Nota Bene

This image requires a host OS with NVIDIA's CUDA driver (version 6.5) to access any CUDA device.
